In this project my client, The Gaming Room, wanted to develop a web-based game available on all platforms. Listing the characteristics and advantages and disadvantages of each operating platform was the most helpful asset in developing the code and I also think I did particularly well in this section. Meeting the clients requirements was the most important factor for designing the code because it makes or breaks the project and can affect my future clientele. Knowing what is asked of me and designing the software to fit these accomadations is what makes a great application and is what I will use to analye and design similar software applications in the future.
